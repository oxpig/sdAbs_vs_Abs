    "Structural clustering output gives, for all of H1 H2 and H3 for both Abs and Nbs, the PDB structure and their cluster (a representative PDB structure). This representative structure will be matched with a canonical form. We want to know how structurally different Abs and Nbs loops are/whether they occupy different structural space. Some clusters contain both Abs and Nbs structures. To find if this is significant, we can randomly sample the clusters and find the number/proportion of structures that fall into these 'overlap' clusters by chance. We will use this as a baseline with which to compare the actual number of structures that fall into overlap clusters. "
